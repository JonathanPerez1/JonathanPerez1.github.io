        <p class="lead mb-4">This website has been created in order to showcase all my qualifications, work experience, and make it easier for employers to find my contact information as well as references. As stated in the prior sentence, the aim of this website is to showcase my work experience in order to prove I am qualified for the Job I have applied for, but first, let me introduce myself. My Name is Jonathan Perez-Lopez. I am 22 years old and a full-time student at UC Riverside. My major is History, and if I have not already graduated by the time you read this, I hope to be working as a History teacher at Garden Grove Unified School District. Teaching has always been my dream career ever since middle school. This stems from my positive experiences with all my History and English teachers, whom I consider exemplary educators to this day. Their influence has definitely impacted my career choices and even my community service. Throughout middle school and high school junior year, I have been a Sunday School teacher's assistant at my local church. That time as a teacher's assistant helped gauge what is expected of an educator as well as how to educate students in an engaging way. Teaching is not the only thing I am interested in, I am also interested in computers, specifically personal desktop computers. I have always enjoyed playing video games, and one day I went down a rabbit hole into the world of gaming on a personal computer. I discovered things such as Overclocking and building custom computers specifically meant for gaming! Of course, this was not a cheap interest and I wanted the best pc I could afford, which left me in a conundrum,  as a high school student, I could look for entry-level jobs at a local fast-food chain, but at the same time, I was not an academically gifted student. Because of this, I tried a different route, and that was to start my own business putting together gaming computers as well as a relatively unknown service of â€˜OverClockingâ€™ computers for gaming for friends, and people were recommended by me. Unfortunately, with he advent of COVID-19, any progress I made in my endeavors completely disappeared, but I did not lose my resolve. At the same time, in high school, my father started his own butchery business, which had originally inspired me to start my own business. Not wanting to let my dad do everything on his own, I decided to join him in his business venture, and while I attended community college, I was also doing the paperwork side of the business. Cut to 2025, and we now operate in  2 different locations, and I am less than 1.5 years away from graduating with a Bachelor's. The journey so far has not been easy as I have had to manage 3 aspects of my life simultaneously: my social, academic, and business. But regardless of the hardships I have faced, I keep my chin up and my spirits high as I grow into adulthood and with over 5 years of successful management, I can confidently say I have more than enough basic secretarial skills to venture out into the job market, and I hope to recreate my current success in managing a business's paperwork.
